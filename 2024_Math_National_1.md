### Question 9
```
Please complete the following multiple-choice question. The question has four options, and at least one of them is correct. Select all options that are correct. 

Question: To understand the income (in 10,000$) after implementing an export stimulus, a sample was taken from a planting area. The sample average income after the export stimulus was found to be $\bar{x} = 2.1$ with a sample variance of $s^2 = 0.01$. It is known that the income before the export stimulus, $X$, follows a normal distribution $N(1.8, 0.1^2)$. Assuming the income after the export stimulus, $Y$, follows a normal distribution $N(\bar{x}, s^2)$, and given that when a random variable $Z$ follows a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, $P(Z < \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.8413$, which of the following is correct?

Option A: $P(X > 2) > 0.2$

### Question 12
```
Given the hyperbola C: $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0)$ with the left foci $F_1$, and right foci $F_2$. A line passing through $F_2$ and parallel to the $y$-axis intersects $C$ at points $A$ and $B$. If $|F_1A| = 13$ and $|AB| = 10$, find the eccentricity of $C$
```
### Question 13

```
### Question 14
```
A and B each have four cards. Each card has a number on it. A's cards are labeled 1, 3, 5, 7, and B's cards are labeled 2, 4, 6, 8. The two players play four rounds. In each round, each player randomly selects one of their own cards, and they compare the numbers on the selected cards. The player with the larger number gets 1 point, and the player with the smaller number gets 0 points. The selected cards are then discarded and cannot be used in subsequent rounds. After four rounds, find the probability that A's total score is at least 2

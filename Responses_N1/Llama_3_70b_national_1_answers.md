## Answers to single-choice questions from Llama 3 70b 
### Question 1
```

To find $A \cap B$, we need to find the elements of $B$ that satisfy the condition $-5 < x^3 < 5$.
Let's check each element of $B$:
* $-3$: $(-3)^3 = -27 < -5$, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.
* $-1$: $(-1)^3 = -1$, which satisfies the condition.
* $0$: $0^3 = 0$, which satisfies the condition.
* $2$: $2^3 = 8 > 5$, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.
* $3$: $3^3 = 27 > 5$, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.
Therefore, the elements of $B$ that satisfy the condition are $-1$ and $0$. So, the correct answer is:
Option A: ${-1, 0}$

```
### Question 2
```
Let's solve for z:
\begin{align*}
\frac{z}{z-1} &= 1 + i \\
z &= (1 + i)(z - 1) \\
z &= z - 1 + iz - i \\
z - iz &= -1 + i \\
z(1 - i) &= -1 + i \\
z &= \frac{-1 + i}{1 - i} \\
z &= \frac{-1 + i}{1 - i} \cdot \frac{1 + i}{1 + i} \\
z &= \frac{-1 + i + i - i^2}{1 - i^2} \\
z &= \frac{-1 + 2i + 1}{2} \\
z &= \frac{2i}{2} \\
z &= i
\end{align*}
However, none of the options match our result. The correct answer is $i$, but it's not among the options.

### Question 3
```
Let's break it down step by step.
We are given two vectors: `a = (0, 1)` and `b = (2, x)`. We need to find the value of `x` such that `b` is perpendicular to `(b - 4a)`.
First, let's calculate `b - 4a`:
```
b - 4a = (2, x) - 4(0, 1) = (2, x) - (0, 4) = (2, x - 4)
```
Now, we are told that `b` is perpendicular to `(b - 4a)`, which means their dot product is zero:
```
b · (b - 4a) = 0
```
Expanding the dot product, we get:
```
(2, x) · (2, x - 4) = 0
2(2) + x(x - 4) = 0
4 + x^2 - 4x = 0
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0
(x - 2)^2 = 0
x - 2 = 0
x = 2
```
So, the correct answer is:
Option D: `2`
```
### Question 4
```
To solve this problem, we can use the trigonometric identity for $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$:

$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$$

We are given that $\cos(\alpha + \beta) = m$, so we can use another trigonometric identity to express $\cos(\alpha + \beta)$ in terms of $\cos(\alpha)$, $\cos(\beta)$, $\sin(\alpha)$, and $\sin(\beta)$:

$$\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = m$$

Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate the $\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)$ term:

$$2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = m + \cos(\alpha - \beta)$$

We are also given that $\tan(\alpha)\tan(\beta) = 2$. Using the fact that $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$, we can rewrite this equation as:

$$\frac{\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)}{\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)} = 2$$

Cross-multiplying, we get:

$$\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = 2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta)$$

Substituting this into our previous equation, we get:

$$2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = m + \cos(\alpha - \beta)$$
$$\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = m + \cos(\alpha - \beta)$$

Subtracting the two equations, we get:

$$\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) - 2\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = 0$$
$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) - m = 0$$
$$\cos(\alpha - \beta) = m$$

However, this is not among the options. But we can see that none of the options are correct, as $\cos(\alpha - \beta)$ is equal to $m$, not $-3m$, $-\frac{m}{3}$, $\frac{m}{3}$, or $3m$.

So, the correct answer is "None of the above".
```
### Question 5
```
Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. The radius of the base of the cylinder and the cone are equal, so let's call this radius "r".
2. The lateral surface areas of the cylinder and the cone are equal. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is 2πrh, where h is the height of the cylinder. The lateral surface area of a cone is πrl, where l is the slant height of the cone. Since they are equal, we can set up the equation:
2πrh = πrl
We are given that the height of the cylinder is √3, so h = √3. We can simplify the equation:
2πr√3 = πrl
Now, divide both sides by πr:
2√3 = l
So, the slant height of the cone is 2√3.
3. The volume of a cone is given by the formula:
V = (1/3)πr²h
We know the radius r, and we need to find the height h of the cone. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the cone:
h² + r² = l²
Substitute the values we know:
h² + r² = (2√3)²
h² + r² = 12
Since the height of the cylinder is √3, we can assume that the radius is also √3 (since the radius of the base of the cylinder and the cone are equal). So, r = √3. Substitute this value:
h² + (√3)² = 12
h² + 3 = 12
Subtract 3 from both sides:
h² = 9
Take the square root of both sides:
h = √9 = 3
Now that we have the height of the cone, we can find the volume:
V = (1/3)π(√3)²(3)
V = (1/3)π(3)(3)
V = 3√3π
So, the correct answer is Option B: 3√3π.
```
### Question 6
```
To ensure that f(x) is strictly increasing on R, the derivative f'(x) must be greater than 0. We can calculate the derivative as follows:
For x < 0:
f'(x) = -2x - 2a > 0
For x ≥ 0:
f'(x) = e^x + 1/(x+1) > 0 (this is always true)
Now, we need to find the range of a such that -2x - 2a > 0 for all x < 0.
Since x < 0, -2x > 0. Therefore, we need -2a > 0, which implies a < 0.
So, the correct answer is Option A: (-∞, 0].
```
### Question 7
```
The correct answer is Option C: $6$.
Explanation:
To find the number of intersection points between the curves y = sin(x) and y = 2sin(3x - π/6), we need to find the values of x that satisfy both equations.
We can start by rewriting the second equation as:
y = 2sin(3x - π/6) = 2sin(3(x - π/18))
Now, we can equate the two equations:
sin(x) = 2sin(3(x - π/18))
This equation has multiple solutions, and we can find them by using the following identity:
sin(a) = sin(b) => a = b + 2kπ or a = π - b + 2kπ, where k is an integer.
Applying this identity to our equation, we get:
x = 3(x - π/18) + 2kπ or x = π - 3(x - π/18) + 2kπ
Simplifying these equations, we get:
x = π/2 + 2kπ/5 or x = 5π/6 + 2kπ/5
Now, we need to find the values of x that lie within the interval [0, 2π]. We can do this by iterating over the values of k:
For k = 0, we get x = π/2 and x = 5π/6, which are both within the interval.
For k = 1, we get x = 9π/10 and x = 13π/10, which are both within the interval.
For k = 2, we get x = 17π/10 and x = 21π/10, which are both within the interval.
For k = 3, we get x = 25π/10 and x = 29π/10, which are both outside the interval.
Therefore, we have a total of 6 intersection points: x = π/2, x = 5π/6, x = 9π/10, x = 13π/10, x = 17π/10, and x = 21π/10.
Hence, the correct answer is Option C: 6.
```
### Question 8
```
Let's analyze the given information:
1. $f(x) > f(x-1) + f(x-2)$ for all $x$.
2. $f(x) = x$ for $x < 3$.
We can start by finding $f(3)$:
$f(3) > f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3$, so $f(3) > 3$.
Now, let's find $f(4)$:
$f(4) > f(3) + f(2) > 3 + 2 = 5$, so $f(4) > 5$.
Similarly, we can find $f(5)$:
$f(5) > f(4) + f(3) > 5 + 3 = 8$, so $f(5) > 8$.
We can continue this process to find:
$f(6) > 13$, $f(7) > 21$, $f(8) > 34$, $f(9) > 55$, and $f(10) > 89$.
Now, let's look at the options:
Option A: $f(10) > 100$ is false, since we found $f(10) > 89$.
Option B: $f(20) > 1000$ is true, since $f(20)$ will be much larger than 1000 due to the recursive nature of the function.
Option C: $f(10) < 1000$ is true, since we found $f(10) > 89$.
Option D: $f(20) < 10000$ is false, since $f(20)$ will be much larger than 10000.
The correct answer is Option B: $f(20) > 1000$.

Data contamination is a major concern in the evaluation of LLMs. Meanwhile, the Gaokao (Chinese College Entrance Examination) is known for its strict security measures and the innovative nature of its questions, which are designed to maintain fairness and confidentiality. These features make the newly conducted Gaokao an ideal source of questions for evaluating LLMs while minimizing the risk of data contamination. 

In this repository, we provide translated versions of the Gaokao 2024 mathematics (6/7/2024) questions along with the corresponding responses generated by widely used LLMs.
